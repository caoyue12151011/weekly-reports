#### **New night mode**

1. Our existing day/night switching method didn't work well in the Shandong case. I've studied the following methods with 24-hr video data (Note: by eye inspection, camera 206&207 need to switch to the night mode at night due to the significant noise)

   1. luminance threshold. Can't distinguish 206/207 from the other cameras.
